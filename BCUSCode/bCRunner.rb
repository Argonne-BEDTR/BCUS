# runBC: Function to call Bayesian Calibration code in R
#

#         Use this function to:
#            1. Convert Ruby parameters into R parameters
#			 2. Call Bayesian Calibration code in R

# CALLED BY: bCRunner.rb
# CALLS: runmcmc.R

#==============================================================#
#                        REQUIRED INPUTS                       #
#==============================================================#
# params_filename: name for file with info on parameter prior distributions
# com_filename: name for file with info results of computer model runs
# field_filename: name for file info on observed data used for calibration
# numOutputVars = number of y (output) variables in input files
# numWeatherVars = number of x (e.g., weather) variables in input files
# numMCMCSteps: the number of steps to run the mcmc algorithm for
# pvals_filename: filename that diagnositc results of mcmc runs will be saved to
# posteriorDist_filename: filename that posterior distributions for parameters
#   will be saved to

#===============================================================#
#                           OUTPUTS                             #
#===============================================================#
# None, but runmcmc.R will generate output files
#
# posteriorDists: posterior realizations (nmcmc x nparms)
# pvals: posterior realizations for parameters and hyperparameters
