# GENDIST Function to create a distance structure

#         Use this function to:
#            1. Store information on size of original design matrix
#            2. Create and store distance array

# CALLED BY: etaxpred.R, yxpred.R, gaspmcmc.R, setupParams.R

# x: design matrix (n x p)
# inds: a list of coordinates of the distance matrix to generate
#   distances for (generate distance between ith row and jth row
#   of the design matrix
